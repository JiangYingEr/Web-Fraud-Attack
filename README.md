# Project Overview
**Web Fraud Attacks (WFA)** aim to induce LLM-driven multi-agent systems (MAS) to believe a malicious website as benign, which will become a sprindboard for attackers to launch subsequent attacks, significantly amplifying the attack surface.

## 1. Why Proposing Web Fraud Attacks?
This work is motivated by an irresistible trend that, *people increasingly expect that agents can directly obtain real-time information from the Internet and help them perform operations on websites, and techniques like Model Context Protocol (MCP) makes this demand feasible*. As a result, we believe that visiting websites will become one of the major functions of MAS in the future.
