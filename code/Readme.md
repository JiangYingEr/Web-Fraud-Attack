## Project Structure
By default, the .py files in the following directories are built using MetaGPT.
```

├── struct1/  # Linear
├── struct2/  # Review           
├── struct3/  # Debate
├── struct4/  # Vote

```

## 1. Install Dependencies
```
pip install metagpt
```
## 2. Configure llm for agents
```
~/.metagpt/config2.yaml
llm:
    model: "deepseek-reasoner"
    base_url: "https://api.deepseek.com"  # or forward url / other llm url
    api_key: <DEEPSEEK_API_KEY>

```
## 3. Run
```
python struct1/linear_defense0.py
```

## Note
We found that the results show a certain degree of randomness, e.g., the results of every ten times are not exactly the same. Therefore, the attack success rates you observe may not be completely identical to those in our paper.
